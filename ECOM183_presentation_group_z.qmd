    -   Energy consumption patterns across different income levels.

4.  **Pricing Models**

    -   Uniform vs. Ramsey pricing; implications for consumer surplus.

5.  **Conclusion**

    -   Efficacy of income-based energy policies; policy recommendations.

## Introduction and Background {.smaller}

-   **Rising Wholesale Energy Prices:** Steep increase due to post-Covid recovery and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.^[10]^

-   **Impact on Consumer Bills:** Expected rise in energy costs for consumers, with projections ranging from £3000 to £4500 annually^[9]^, significantly higher than the previous maximum of £1600 per year^[11]^.

-   **Government Response:**

    -   **Energy Price Guarantee (EPG):** A policy aimed at stabilising energy prices.
    -   **Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS):** A measure to directly support consumer energy expenses.
    -   **Both:** Implemenetd to reduce the negative externalities associated with reductions in energy consumption.

**Objective of Analysis:** To study the effectiveness of EPG and EBSS, employing a microeconomic perspective to assess the impact of these interventions.

## Introduction and Background {.smaller}

1.  **Energy Price Guarantee (EPG)**:

    -   **Nature**: Unit rate subsidy applied at the point of use.

    -   **Impact**: Reduces the cost per unit of electricity, leading to lower overall energy costs.

    -   **Consumer Perception**: Subtler impact, as the discount is applied directly to the unit cost.
:::

::: {.column style="font-size: 75%;"}
2.  **Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS)**:

    -   **Nature**: Direct grant of £400 over 6 months, distributed in installments.

    -   **Implementation**: Majority receive this as credit on their energy accounts.

    -   **Consumer Perception**: More noticeable impact, clearly visible on electricity bills.

## Introduction and Background

::: {.callout-warning title="Key Differences"}
**EPG**: *Volumetric subsidy* - higher consumption leads to greater savings.

**EBSS**: *Uniform subsidy* for all consumers, regardless of consumption levels.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Implications"}
**EPG**: May incentivise higher consumption due to per-unit savings.

**EBSS**: Offers equal relief to all, with proportionally less impact on higher consumers.

## Energy and an Inelastic Good {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
The price elasticity (PE) of demand is a measure of how sensitive price is to the quantity demanded. The literature shows that the PE of energy is inelastic across a range of variables (e.g, country, time, etc.)^\[1,2,3\]^.

Intuitively, this is expected as energy is recognised as a **necessary good**^\[4\]^, meaning it fulfils some essential needs for a consumer. Some examples are cooking, heating and lighting.

However, energy is *not* perfectly inelastic as it does service discretionary needs, such as running appliances, recreation, maintaining lifestyle choices.

Finally, consumers are constrained in their ability to adjust their consumption in the short or long term (e.g., investing in energy efficiency measures).

## Estimating Energy Elasticity by Income Level {.smaller}

A meta-analysis^\[6\]^ gives the following PEs for Energy and sub-types we are focusing on[^1]:

[^1]: \* significant at the 10% level \| \*\*\* significant at the 1% level

::: columns
::: column
| Good        | Short-term   | Long-term    |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Energy      | -0.207\*\*\* | -0.608\*\*\* |
| Electricity | -0.126\*     | -0.365\*     |
| Natural Gas | -0.180\*\*\* | -0.684\*\*\* |
:::

::: column
These PEs are an **aggregate** value from different countries (developed, developing), consumer types (residential, industrial, commercial) and time periods.

However, they are a sensible starting point for our microeconomic framework.
:::
:::

Literature is sparse in finding how the PE of energy changes for income levels, however this is available for water^\[7\]^.

We argue that water is a similar, necessary good to Energy sharing many of the same characteristics discussed previously.

## Estimating Energy Elasticity by Income Level {.smaller}

We take the Water PE distribution over incomes levels and “fit” this to an aggregated PE for Energy, Electricity and Natural Gas (average between short-term and long-term PEs).

Assumption that the change in PE for water (roughly linear) is the same for Energy due to being a similar good

|                | Low Income | Middle Income | Upper Income | High Income | Mean   |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Water PE       | -0.565     | -0.490        | -0.460       | -0.397      | -0.500 |
| Energy PE      | -0.688     | -0.596        | -0.560       | -0.483      | -0.608 |
| Electricity EP | -0.413     | -0.358        | -0.336       | -0.290      | -0.365 |
| Natural Gas PE | -0.774     | -0.671        | -0.630       | -0.544      | -0.684 |

## Investigating Pricing Mechanisms

The EPG was implemented as a unit rate subsidy at point of use, it reduced the cost of each individual unit of electricity consumed.

This was uniform across all domestic consumers and therefore not means tested.

::: {.callout-note title="Our Research"}
We know PED of energy changes as *income* changes. How can we use this information to determine the optimal price to consumers?

This modelling investigates the price to consumers if the rate was determined solely by the market.
:::

## Model Set Up {.smaller}

### The Consumer

We assume two consumers: High Income (HI) and Low Income (LI).

Demand function for High Income Consumers:

$$q_{HI} = A - B * p_{HI}$$

Demand function for Low Income Consumers:

$$q_{LI} = C - D * p_{LI}$$

These equations represent the basic linear demand relationship where $q$ is the quantity demanded in MWh, and $p$ is the price in £/MWh.

> The quantity demanded *decreases* as the price increases.

## Model Set Up {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

### The Consumer

Here we select four different parameters: `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`

```{python}
#| echo: false

# Neccessary Libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
```

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Define the parameters for the demand functions of High Income (HI) and Low Income (LI) groups
# Demand function for HI: q_HI = A - B * p_HI
# Demand function for LI: q_LI = C - D * p_LI
A, B, C, D = 0.05, 0.01875, 0.04, 0.03  # A, B for HI and C, D for LI
# Alternative
A, B, C, D = 0.1, 0.324, 0.15, 0.461  # A, B for HI and C, D for LI
```

In general, the intercepts (`A` and `C`) tell us about the baseline consumption levels without the influence of price, reflecting factors like needs, preferences, and possibly non-price related socio-economic factors.

The slopes (`B` and `D`), on the other hand, provide insight into how responsive each group is to price changes, indicating their price elasticity of demand.

::: callout-important
These parameters have been chosen in line with the evidence already laid out.
:::

## Model Set Up {auto-animate="true"}

Next, we can specify the PED for each of the Income Groups based on our empircal estimates.

| Income Level | \% in UK | Energy PE | Electricity PE | National Gas PE |
|--------------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Low          | 0.25     | -0.461    | -0.278         | -0.489          |
| Middle       | 0.55     | -0.400    | -0.241         | -0.424          |
| Upper        | 0.15     | -0.375    | -0.226         | -0.398          |
| High         | 0.05     | -0.324    | -0.195         | -0.34           |

```{python}
#| echo: true
epsilon_HI, epsilon_LI = -0.324, -0.461 
```

## Model Set Up {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

### The Firm

Now we need to specify parameters relevant to the firm. Specifically, the firm faces 3 key constraints:

1)  The Capacity Constraint;
2)  The Break-Even Constraint;
3)  The Demand Constraint;

We can define the parameters as follows:

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Fixed costs that the energy provider needs to cover and the number of days per month
fixed_costs = 30  # Daily fixed costs in £

# Capacity constraint (maximum energy supply per day) and daily break-even revenue
capacity_constraint = 1000  # MWh per day
break_even_revenue = fixed_costs / days_per_month  # Daily revenue needed to break even

# Marginal cost of supplying energy in £/MWh
MC = 67
```

## The Uniform Pricing Scenario {auto-animate="true"}

```{python}
#| output: false
#| echo: true

# Uniform pricing scenario: A single price for both groups
# Define functions for total demand and revenue with a uniform price
def total_demand_uniform_price(price):
    demand_HI = A - B * price
    demand_LI = C - D * price
    total_demand = demand_HI + demand_LI
    return min(total_demand, capacity_constraint)  # Ensure demand does not exceed capacity

def total_revenue_uniform_price(price):
    return price * total_demand_uniform_price(price)

# Define a function for the break-even constraint under uniform pricing
def break_even_uniform_price_constraint(price):
    return total_revenue_uniform_price(price) - break_even_revenue

# Solve for the uniform price that meets the break-even requirement
uniform_price_initial_guess = 10
uniform_price_solution = fsolve(break_even_uniform_price_constraint, 
                                uniform_price_initial_guess)[0]

```

The optimal price under uniform pricing can then be given as:

```{python}
#| echo: false
round(uniform_price_solution, ndigits=2)
```

## The Uniform Pricing Scenario {auto-animate="true"}

Using this price, we can then calculate consumer surplus.

```{python}
#| output: false
#| echo: true

# Function to calculate consumer surplus: CS = 0.5 * base * height
def calculate_consumer_surplus(a, b, price):
    base = a - b * price  # base of the demand triangle
    height = a / b - price  # height of the demand triangle
    return 0.5 * base * height  # Area representing consumer surplus

# Consumer surplus for HI and LI under uniform pricing
cs_HI_uniform = calculate_consumer_surplus(A, B, uniform_price_solution)
cs_LI_uniform = calculate_consumer_surplus(C, D, uniform_price_solution)

```

```{python}
print(f"Uniform Price: £{uniform_price_solution:.2f}")
print(f"High Income Consumer Surplus: £{cs_HI_uniform:.2f}")
print(f"Low Income Consumer Surplus: £{cs_LI_uniform:.2f}")
```

## Price Discrimination {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

Ramsey Pricing is an economic principle used for price setting, particularly in regulated markets or industries with significant fixed costs.

It aims to minimise the welfare loss associated with taxation or pricing above marginal costs, while ensuring that firms cover their total costs, including the need for a reasonable rate of return.

### Key Components of the Ramsey Pricing Model

1)  **Pricing Formula:** The price $(p_i)$ for each group is set such that $(p_i - MC_{i})/{p_i} = k/\varepsilon_i$

2)  **Revenue Calculation:** The total revenue is calculated by applying the derived prices for the HI and LI groups to their respective demand functions

3)  **Break-even Constraint:** This constraint ensures that the total revenue matches the break-even revenue, which is necessary for the sustainability of operations.

## Ramsey pricing {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Define a function to calculate total revenue based on Ramsey pricing
def revenue(k):
    # Prices for HI and LI are calculated using the Ramsey formula
    p_HI = MC / (1 - k * epsilon_HI)
    p_LI = MC / (1 - k * epsilon_LI)
    
    # Quantities demanded for HI and LI are derived from the demand functions
    q_HI = A - B * p_HI
    q_LI = C - D * p_LI
    
    # Total revenue calculation
    return p_HI * q_HI + p_LI * q_LI

# Define a function for the break-even constraint
def break_even_constraint(k):
    # The revenue must match the break-even revenue for sustainability
    return revenue(k) - break_even_revenue

# Solve for k using fsolve, with an initial guess
k_initial = 10
k_solution = fsolve(break_even_constraint, k_initial)[0]

# Calculate the prices for HI and LI using the solved value of k
p_HI_solution = MC / (1 - k_solution * epsilon_HI)
p_LI_solution = MC / (1 - k_solution * epsilon_LI)


# Consumer surplus for HI and LI under Ramsey pricing
cs_HI_ramsey = calculate_consumer_surplus(A, B, p_HI_solution)
cs_LI_ramsey = calculate_consumer_surplus(C, D, p_LI_solution)

## Conclusion {.smaller}

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The “Price Shock” in Summer-22 caused Energy as a spend of expenditure to rise over 20pp from Oct-21 to Jan-23 for the Lowest Decile Income Household and over 5pp for the Highest Decile Income.

EBSS and EPG delivered rapidly, in a crisis - with the aim to protect consumer welfare.
:::

::: columns

![](images/energy_as_share_of_income.png)
:::

::: column
EBSS and EPG criticised for not being more targeted^\[8\]^ but unclear *how much more* value for money or efficient a targeted policy may have been.

We have attempted to create a framework to allow policy makers to understand the “**value space**” that a more targeted policy can access
:::
:::

## Conclusion {.smaller}

We have shown that there is likely a significant difference in price elasticity for energy at different income groups.

-   Lower-income households are less inelastic than higher-income

-   But this can only be up to a point where all discretionary spending on energy stops

By using PEs for different income groups, we have shown that there is a change in consumer welfare impact when using a price based policy intervention - which is likely inefficient

There is a “Value Space” to more targeted policies.

::: {.callout-important title="Findings"}
With more detailed, accurate information - Policy Makers could use this framework like this to assess whether to employ targeted approach (which takes more time and resource) versus a blanket approach.
